### 1. Master Patient Indices

When dealing with a large database of patients, it’s common for records to get lost or jumbled up. Furthermore, depending on the EHR you choose, there might be significant differences in the way databases are recorded, which complicates even the most basic data. All of the records are entered into a single data entry book, or ledger, at the same time. For example, if you look for a person’s address, you’ll find a number of addresses and various keys, but you’ll only get one patient ID (Ivan, 2016).

### 2. Supply Chain Management

The use of Blockchain technology in healthcare could aid in the screening of supply-demand cycles. For example, how does a monetary transaction take place? Is the contract that your company has accepted going well? Is there any sort of hold-up? All of these details could be easily tracked with Blockchain.

### 3. Claims Adjudication

Because Blockchain is a transaction and exchange system based on validation, claims are automatically validated when the system approves the way by which a contract is carried out. Furthermore, because there is no central authority, the odds of frauds and mistakes occurring are little to none.

### Interoperability

Blockchain technology makes use of sophisticated APIs to make data storage and EHR interoperability a standardized process. Because the Blockchain network is only disseminated to authorize persons in a safe manner, it eliminates the additional costs associated with data reconciliation. Aside from the previously mentioned advantages, Blockchain technology has the ability to improve clinical trials, revenue cycle management, medication supply management, and fraud prevention.

### Existing Problems and Constraints in Healthcare Using Blockchain Technology:

#### Technological Challenges:
1) **Throughput**: Increasing transactions and nodes may lead to network bottleneck, affecting timely access crucial for diagnosis.
   
2) **Latency**: Validation time of about 10 minutes per block can compromise system security, critical in healthcare analysis.
   
3) **Security**: Control by a single party with 51% voting power can undermine network computing power, risking healthcare system integrity.
   
4) **Resource Consumption**: Energy-intensive mining process can lead to significant resource loss, challenging for healthcare settings already consuming high energy.
   
5) **Usability**: Complexity poses usability challenges; user-friendly interfaces and APIs are needed for adoption, considering varying levels of IT proficiency among healthcare professionals.
   
6) **Centralization**: Certain implementations concentrate miners, reducing network stability and increasing vulnerability to attacks.
   
7) **Privacy**: Blockchain's privacy assurances are disputed; strategies for privacy protection are needed to comply with regulations like GDPR and address users' concerns about data safety and ethical use.
   
8) **Constraint**: Constraints extend beyond technical aspects to include social facets such as trust in administration and technology infrastructure.
   
9) **Costs**: Implementing blockchain systems entails time, capital, and economic expenses, with additional costs associated with protocol, operational overhead, access latency, and time consumption.

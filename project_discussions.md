### 1. Master Patient Indices

When dealing with a large database of patients, it’s common for records to get lost or jumbled up. Furthermore, depending on the EHR you choose, there might be significant differences in the way databases are recorded, which complicates even the most basic data. All of the records are entered into a single data entry book, or ledger, at the same time. For example, if you look for a person’s address, you’ll find a number of addresses and various keys, but you’ll only get one patient ID (Ivan, 2016).

### 2. Supply Chain Management

The use of Blockchain technology in healthcare could aid in the screening of supply-demand cycles. For example, how does a monetary transaction take place? Is the contract that your company has accepted going well? Is there any sort of hold-up? All of these details could be easily tracked with Blockchain.

### 3. Claims Adjudication

Because Blockchain is a transaction and exchange system based on validation, claims are automatically validated when the system approves the way by which a contract is carried out. Furthermore, because there is no central authority, the odds of frauds and mistakes occurring are little to none.

### Interoperability

Blockchain technology makes use of sophisticated APIs to make data storage and EHR interoperability a standardized process. Because the Blockchain network is only disseminated to authorize persons in a safe manner, it eliminates the additional costs associated with data reconciliation. Aside from the previously mentioned advantages, Blockchain technology has the ability to improve clinical trials, revenue cycle management, medication supply management, and fraud prevention.

### Existing Problems and Constraints in Healthcare Using Blockchain Technology:

#### Technological Challenges:
1) **Throughput**: Increasing transactions and nodes may lead to network bottleneck, affecting timely access crucial for diagnosis.
   
2) **Latency**: Validation time of about 10 minutes per block can compromise system security, critical in healthcare analysis.
   
3) **Security**: Control by a single party with 51% voting power can undermine network computing power, risking healthcare system integrity.
   
4) **Resource Consumption**: Energy-intensive mining process can lead to significant resource loss, challenging for healthcare settings already consuming high energy.
   
5) **Usability**: Complexity poses usability challenges; user-friendly interfaces and APIs are needed for adoption, considering varying levels of IT proficiency among healthcare professionals.
   
6) **Centralization**: Certain implementations concentrate miners, reducing network stability and increasing vulnerability to attacks.
   
7) **Privacy**: Blockchain's privacy assurances are disputed; strategies for privacy protection are needed to comply with regulations like GDPR and address users' concerns about data safety and ethical use.
   
8) **Constraint**: Constraints extend beyond technical aspects to include social facets such as trust in administration and technology infrastructure.
   
9) **Costs**: Implementing blockchain systems entails time, capital, and economic expenses, with additional costs associated with protocol, operational overhead, access latency, and time consumption.

#### Major Healthcare Domains Where Blockchain Technology Has Been Used:

**Sharing Health Information:**
- MedRec
- Medicalchain

**Remote Care with IoT:**
- Patient-Centric Agent (PCA)

**Supply Chain for Healthcare:**
- Modum

**Security and Privacy:**
- Decentralized Sharing of Health Records (DSHR)

### Main Challenges to Address in Developing a Blockchain-based EHR:

1. **Data Privacy and Security**: Ensure that patient data remains private and secure throughout the system, adhering to regulations like GDPR and HIPAA.

2. **Scalability**: Design the system to handle a large volume of transactions and users without compromising performance.

3. **Interoperability**: Ensure seamless integration with existing healthcare systems and interoperability between different platforms and stakeholders.

4. **Usability**: Develop a user-friendly interface for healthcare professionals to easily navigate and utilize the EHR system effectively.

5. **Cost-effectiveness**: Optimize resource usage and minimize operational costs associated with deploying and maintaining the blockchain-based EHR.

6. **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure compliance with healthcare regulations and standards to avoid legal issues and maintain trust among users.

7. **Consensus Mechanism**: Choose an appropriate consensus mechanism that balances decentralization, security, and efficiency for validating transactions on the blockchain.

8. **Data Integrity**: Implement mechanisms to ensure the integrity and immutability of patient data stored on the blockchain to prevent tampering or unauthorized access.

9. **Patient Consent and Control**: Design features that allow patients to have control over their health data and consent to its use for specific purposes.

10. **Educational Outreach**: Provide educational resources and training for healthcare professionals and patients to understand and effectively use the blockchain-based EHR system.

11. **Ethical Considerations**: Address ethical concerns related to data ownership, consent, and access rights to ensure fairness and transparency in the EHR ecosystem.

12. **Integration with Emerging Technologies**: Explore integration opportunities with emerging technologies like IoT, AI, and telemedicine to enhance the functionality and capabilities of the EHR system.

13. **Sustainability**: Consider the environmental impact of blockchain technology and design the system to be environmentally sustainable by minimizing energy consumption and carbon footprint.

14. **User Feedback and Iterative Improvement**: Solicit feedback from users and stakeholders to identify areas for improvement and iterate on the EHR system continuously.

Addressing these challenges will be essential for creating a robust and effective blockchain-based EHR system that meets the needs of healthcare providers, patients, and regulatory bodies.


## To address these issues, we'll focus on immediate fixes for short-term project goals and outline plans for addressing long-term challenges in the future.

### 1. Master Patient Indices

When dealing with a large database of patients, it’s common for records to get lost or jumbled up. Furthermore, depending on the EHR you choose, there might be significant differences in the way databases are recorded, which complicates even the most basic data. All of the records are entered into a single data entry book, or ledger, at the same time. For example, if you look for a person’s address, you’ll find a number of addresses and various keys, but you’ll only get one patient ID (Ivan, 2016).

### 2. Supply Chain Management

The use of Blockchain technology in healthcare could aid in the screening of supply-demand cycles. For example, how does a monetary transaction take place? Is the contract that your company has accepted going well? Is there any sort of hold-up? All of these details could be easily tracked with Blockchain.

### 3. Claims Adjudication

Because Blockchain is a transaction and exchange system based on validation, claims are automatically validated when the system approves the way by which a contract is carried out. Furthermore, because there is no central authority, the odds of frauds and mistakes occurring are little to none.

### Interoperability

Blockchain technology makes use of sophisticated APIs to make data storage and EHR interoperability a standardized process. Because the Blockchain network is only disseminated to authorize persons in a safe manner, it eliminates the additional costs associated with data reconciliation. Aside from the previously mentioned advantages, Blockchain technology has the ability to improve clinical trials, revenue cycle management, medication supply management, and fraud prevention.
